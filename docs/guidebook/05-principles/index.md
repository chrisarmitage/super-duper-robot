# Guidebook > Principles

Due to the nature of this project, heavy emphasis will be placed on the architectural and design pattern principles.

- Use Hexagonal Architecture for defining the Framework, Application and Domain.
- Use CQRS to allow rapid data querying.
- Use Twig as a templating engine to prevent any business logic in the views.
- Always use Dependency Injection.
- Follow SOLID.
- Use the Repository design pattern for data access.
- Use Unit of Work to ensure data integrity.
- Use fat models and skinny controllers.
- Use Domain Events for loose coupling.
