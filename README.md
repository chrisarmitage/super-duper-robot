I've been studying application architecture for a few years now, from basic DI up to CQRS and Event Sourcing. These all look like great patterns, but there aren't many examples of the code being used in real-world environments. I want to see if it's possible to create a commercially-viable product using modern design patterns.

## The Plan

Create an e-commerce platform, with all the basic features needed to fulfil order management. The intention isn't to build a platform to rival Magento, it's to see if it's possible. I expect to gain far more from the journey than the end product.

## Resources

Where possible, I'll be drawing knowledge from:

- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
- [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/)
- [Software Architecture for Developers](https://softwarearchitecturefordevelopers.com/)
- [Hexagonal Architecture](https://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture)
- [Domain-Driven Design in PHP](https://leanpub.com/ddd-in-php)
- [Microservice Architecture](https://microservices.io/)
- [Build APIs You Won't Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/books/build-apis-you-wont-hate.html)

Others will be added as I explore different areas, and I'm happy to take recommendations on reading material.

## Initial steps

Go through the design process in Software Architecture for Developers, lay out what I'm wanting to achieve.

## FAQs

Q: Why is the project called Super Duper Robot?

A: The fickle fate of GitHub's repository name suggester. Sounded like a nice name if I ever talk about this project at conferences.
